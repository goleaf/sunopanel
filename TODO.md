## Laravel Codebase Refactoring (Based on laravel.mdc)

- [x] **Review Controllers:** Ensure all controllers in `app/Http/Controllers` are `final`, read-only (properties), thin, and use method injection or service classes for dependencies.
    - [x] Check `BatchController.php` (Confirmed final & readonly. Form Requests deferred until features implemented.)
    - [x] Check `GenreController.php` (Refactored to use GenreService)
    - [x] Check `PlaylistController.php` (Refactored to use PlaylistService)
    - [x] Check `TrackController.php` (Refactored to use TrackService)
    - [x] Check `UserController.php` (Made readonly, moved index logic to UserService)
- [x] **Review Models:** Ensure all models in `app/Models` are `final`.
    - [x] Check `BatchOperation.php` (Confirmed final)
    - [x] Check `Genre.php` (Confirmed final)
    - [x] Check `Playlist.php` (Confirmed final)
    - [x] Check `Track.php` (Confirmed final)
    - [x] Check `User.php` (Confirmed final)
- [x] **Review Services:** Ensure all services in `app/Services` are `final` and read-only (properties).
    - [x] Check `Batch/BatchService.php` (Confirmed final & readonly)
    - [x] Check `Genre/GenreService.php` (Confirmed final & readonly)
    - [x] Check `Logging/LoggingService.php` (Confirmed final & readonly)
    - [x] Check `Playlist/PlaylistService.php` (Confirmed final & readonly)
    - [x] Check `Track/TrackService.php` (Confirmed final & readonly)
    - [x] Check `User/UserService.php` (Confirmed final & readonly)
- [x] **Review Routing:** Consider splitting `routes/web.php` into domain-specific route files (e.g., `routes/track.php`, `routes/playlist.php`) if it becomes large or complex. (Evaluated: Not necessary at current size).

## Review Form Requests
- [x] **Review Form Requests:** Ensure all necessary request validation happens in Form Requests (`app/Http/Requests`). (Most controllers use Form Requests; `BatchController` methods deferred).

## Review Type Declarations
- [x] **Review Type Declarations:** Ensure consistent use of PHP 8.2+ type hints (scalar, return, union, nullable) across controllers, models, and services. (Basic review complete; added missing hints).

## Review Repository/Service Pattern
- [x] **Review Repository/Service Pattern:** Evaluate if the current service structure adequately separates concerns or if a Repository pattern is needed for data access logic. (Evaluated: Current service pattern is sufficient; no repositories needed now).

- [x] **Check for Unused Files:** Identify and remove any unused classes, views, or other files. (Removed unused Playlist Store/Update requests & tests).
