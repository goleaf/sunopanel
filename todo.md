# SunoTest Command Todo List

- [x] Create the SunoTest command file
- [x] Implement the HTTP request functionality
- [x] Add proper error handling
- [x] Test the command availability in Artisan
- [x] Commit changes to the main branch
- [x] Update command to simulate browsing to style page instead of just API search
- [x] Implement song details extraction and display
- [x] Reimplement using Selenium for browser automation with all headers

## Usage

To run the command:

```bash
# Run with browser UI visible
php artisan suno:test

# Run in headless mode (without visible browser)
php artisan suno:test --headless
```

This command will launch a Selenium-controlled Chrome browser that navigates to Suno's style page for "dark trap metalcore", extracts song information from the page, and displays it in the console.

## Requirements

- Selenium WebDriver server running on localhost:4444
- Chrome browser installed on the system
